### CSS LAB 1 

#### Follow these steps:
- In the folder ‘Task3’ open the file task3.html.
- Create an external stylesheet called myStyle.css which you will use to style task1.html. Use the external stylesheet whenever possible but use internal style sheets or in-line style if necessary. The following style rules should be applied to task1.html:
  - All headings should have a background colour of ‘orangered’. (See additional reading ‘CSS notes for professionals’ Chapter 18: Colors)
  - All headings should be centered.
  - The text in all paragraphs should be maroon and Times New Roman. (See additional reading ‘CSS notes for professionals’ Chapter 15: Typography)
  - All the `<h3>` elements should be chocolate in color except for the heading that contains the text “The info below is NOT mine....” which should be in red.
  
  - The image should be centered. (See additional reading ‘CSS centering things’)
  - There should be a margin of 2% around the entire page. (See additional reading ‘CSS notes for professionals’ Chapters 7 and 8)
- At the bottom of the page add a 3x2 table with the headings “Web 1.0”, “Web 2.0” and “Web 3.0”. Add a sentence that describes the key characteristics of each version of the web. Make the column headings of this table centered and red, and the rest of the content purple.
- Centre the table on the page.


#### On finishing the above task. Follow the steps below


- Create files called about.html and myStyles.css in this folder. about.html should contain information about you: your educational history, your work history, who you are and what you’re passionate about. Eventually, you will be building a developer portfolio to showcase your skills. “About.html” could form part of this portfolio.
- Set out the basic HTML document template and give it a title as you see fit.
- Use the following six elements at least once: 
  - h1
  - p
  - img
  - h2
  - h3
  - nav (search and get help if not sure.)
- Depending on the content you have chosen, align some of them on the left, some on the right, and some in the middle.
- The nav bar should be centered and the elements be placed next to each other (horizontally).
Change the background colour of the entire page (hint: think about where all of the content is kept).
- Make all the headings in italics, and change their font family to Times New Roman.
- The following should be added to your elements (1 per element)
  - Text-colour
  - Image-size
  - Border
  - Padding
