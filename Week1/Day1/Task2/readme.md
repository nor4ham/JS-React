### HTML - II Lab Instructions
Open example.html and example2.html in VSCode and read through the comments before attempting these tasks.
##### Task
Follow these steps:
- Open the WebFundamentals.html file which you created in the previously. 
- If you have not yet done so, make sure that your webpage contains appropriate headings and paragraphs.
- Add an appropriate heading and paragraph to your webpage in which you explain in your own words what you should think about before adding images to your website. Note the information here in the red warning box.
- Add at least 3 relevant pictures (either from your PC or online) to your webpage. Don’t worry about the sizes and position for now - we will deal with that in the CSS section.

- Add a heading called “Acknowledgements” to your webpage. Under this heading list all the websites that you have used to access images or information for this task. Add links to each of the websites you have referenced.
- Add a “back to top” link at the bottom of your webpage that will return the user to the top of the webpage when clicked.
- Place the HyperionDev logo (URL given in the example.html file) after your last paragraph. Link this picture so that, when you click on it, it takes you to the HyperionDev website. Hint: Think about what the content in the link that they should click on might be. (Normally it would be text, but what is it now?).
