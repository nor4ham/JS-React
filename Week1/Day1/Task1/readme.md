### HTML1 LAB Work Instructions

Open **example.html** and **example2.html** in VSCode and read through the comments before attempting these tasks.

#### Task 1
Follow these steps:
- Use VS Code to create an HTML file called firstPage.html
- Set out the basic document template.
- Make the title “My first web page with Front End Dev!”
- Make two headings (h1s), with the content being “Hobbies” and “Goals”.
[“Goals” here refers to what you would like to get out of this Bootcamp/what
you would like to be able to do by the end of this Bootcamp.]
- Each of these headings should have two subheadings of type h2 (total of
four). List two items for your hobbies and goals respectively.

- Within these subheadings, create two paragraphs per h2 heading. In each of these paragraphs, mention something about the topic you’re speaking about. You don’t need to make this too long — a sentence is fine (unlessyou’re feeling very creative!).
- Be sure to use italics and bold text in your page — you can choose where.

#### Task 2
Follow these steps:
- Create an HTML file called tables.html in this folder.
- Set out the basic document template, giving it a title and headings as you
see fit.
- Create a table with 3 columns, with column names in bold. These names
should be: “Topic”, “Name of website” and “URL”.
- Populate this table with the details of 3 resources that you have found on
the web that provide useful advice for web developers. Feel free to use
resources referred to in this task.
